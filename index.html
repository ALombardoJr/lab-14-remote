<h1>The Prisoner of Benda</h1>
<p>The alien mothership is in orbit here. If we can hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? It must be wonderful. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Tell her she looks thin.</p>
<h2>Lrrreconcilable Ndndifferences</h2>
<p>I just told you! You've killed me! No argument here. I decline the title of Iron Cook and accept the lesser title of Zinc Saucier, which I just made up. Uhh also, comes with double prize money. Tell her she looks thin. I'm just glad my fat, ugly mama isn't alive to see this day. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!</p>
<ul>
<li>Hey! I'm a porno-dealing monster, what do I care what you think?</li>
<li>I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Where the Buggalo Roam</h3>
<p>They're like sex, except I'm having them! Now Fry, it's been a few years since medical school, so remind me. Disemboweling in your species: fatal or non-fatal? Hey, you add a one and two zeros to that or we walk! I meant 'physically'. Look, perhaps you could let me work for a little food? I could clean the floors or paint a fence, or service you sexually? Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry?</p>
<h4>I, Roommate</h4>
<p>Interesting. No, wait, the other thing: tedious. So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? I never loved you.</p>
<ol>
<li>Please, Don-Bot look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!</li>
<li>Then we'll go with that data file!</li>
<li>Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? ;To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? To shreds, you say.</li>
</ol>
<h5>Put Your Head on my Shoulder</h5>
<p>I don't know what you did, Fry, but once again, you screwed up! Now all the planets are gonna start cracking wise about our mamas. Leela's gonna kill me. Bender, I didn't know you liked cooking. That's so cute. Then we'll go with that data file!</p>
